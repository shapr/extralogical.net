Extralogical consists of articles and code by **Benedict Eastaugh**, a writer,
programmer and erstwhile philosophy student. Arriving on this planet in the
same year as <cite>Blade Runner</cite>, Benedict's days are spent contemplating
the world and its inhabitants---usually in the pub.

His philosophical interests lie in formal logic and formal approaches to
philosophy; foundational questions in the philosophy of mathematics; and the
philosophy of mind and perception.

He maintains an interest in Taoist thought and the works of J.G. Ballard, and
suffers from an irrational obsession with [notebooks]($root/about/notebooks).

Benedict currently works for a web development company in London. To get in
touch, email him at **benedict@eastaugh.net**.
