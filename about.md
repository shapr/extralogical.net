I'm **Benedict Eastaugh**, a postgrad studying logic and philosophy of
mathematics at the University of Bristol. Like most people in the universe
these days, I'm on Twitter as [@extralogical][twitter].

To get in touch, email me at [benedict\@eastaugh.net][mail].

My research interests include foundational questions in the philosophy of
mathematics; using inductive logic to describe the dynamics of neural networks;
and structuralism about mathematics and metaphysics.

I also do a certain amount of programming: my current [projects] include
[Firmin][firmin], a JavaScript animation library, and various experiments with
[Haskell][haskell]. My addictions to [coffee], [notebooks], and the work of
[J.G. Ballard][ballard] and [Philip K. Dick][pkd] have been well-publicised.
[Books on Extralogical][books] is a terrible guide to what I read, but a good
one to what I finish.

Extralogical's HTML is generated with [Hakyll][hakyll] and resides on
[Linode][linode].
