I'm **Benedict Eastaugh**, a postgrad studying for an MA in
logic and philosophy of mathematics at the University of Bristol. Like most
people in the universe these days, I'm on Twitter as [@extralogical][twitter].

To get in touch, email me at [benedict\\@eastaugh.net][mail].

My philosophical interests lie in formal logic and formal approaches to
philosophy; foundational questions in the philosophy of mathematics; and the
philosophy of mind and perception.

An avid programmer, my current [projects] include [Firmin][firmin], a
JavaScript animation library, and various experiments with [Haskell][haskell].
I also have well-publicised addictions to coffee, [notebooks], and the work of
[J.G. Ballard][ballard] and [Philip K. Dick][pkd].

Extralogical's HTML is generated with [Hakyll][hakyll] and resides on
[Linode][linode].
