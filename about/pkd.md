title: Philip K. Dick
---

I was first introduced to Philip K. Dick through his short stories, and I
remember reading _The Man in the High Castle_ when I was fourteen or so. It
made quite an impression on me; I have been a fan of his work ever since.

A few years ago, after reading Emmanual Carr√©'s [biography] of Dick, I decided
to read all of his novels. A quick scan of [his bibliography] revealed that
this would not be possible: several of his novels went unpublished during his
lifetime and the manuscripts have been lost or destroyed.

Fine: I would read all Dick's novels that were there to be read. Some I've
bought new, especially since the [SF Masterworks] series made so many of them
available again. I keep an eye out for them in second-hand bookshops, too;
recently I picked up a copy of a relatively early book, _The World Jones Made_.
Last Christmas, a friend kindly bought me the beautiful [Library of America]
hardbacks, which also included some stories I hadn't read yet.

All in all, I've now read 12 novels, from a total of 44. Here they are in
chronological order.

* _The World Jones Made_
* _Time Out of Joint_
* _The Man in the High Castle_
* _Martian Time-Slip_
* _Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb_
* _The Simulacra_
* _Now Wait for Last Year_
* _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_
* _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_
* _Ubik_
* _A Maze of Death_
* _Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said_

This page will be updated as I make further progress.
