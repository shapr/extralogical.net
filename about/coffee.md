title: Coffee
---

There are probably worse cities in the UK for coffee than Bristol, but it's not
London by any stretch of the imagination. Over the last few years a number of
fantastic new coffee shops and suppliers have sprung up there, nicely
complementing old stagers like [Monmouth].

I have a subscription to [Has Bean][hb] which means I get a new pack of their
excellent filter coffee every month. The variety is fantastic, since they
select a new roast every time. Obviously 250g of coffee doesn't last that long
if you drink a mug or two every day, so I supplement it with visits to
Bristol's own [Two Day Coffee Roasters][td].

Currently I'm mostly drinking filter coffee, which I make with a
[Hario drip pot][hario], but when I feel like something stronger I bust out my
[stovetop]. One day I'd like to own a real espresso machine, and I've
occasionally pondered building one as an engineering project.

When I'm in London I try to find time to go to at least one of Monmouth,
[Tapped & Packed][tp] and [Fernandez & Wells][fw]. The Monmouth espresso blend
is particularly good; when I worked in the area, I used to go to their Borough
Market shop a couple of times a week and get a flat white. Tasting the
variations in the blend over time was fascinating.
