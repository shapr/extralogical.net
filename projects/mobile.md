This downloadable PDF template will allow you to create your very own fish
mobile. The template only uses black ink, so it should print on any normal
desktop printer.

The mobile made its debut in [this entry]($root/2006/01/fish-mobile), which
includes a small gallery of readers' mobiles. If you've made your own, please,
[send in]($root/about) a photo or three!

Instructions
------------

_Step 1:_ print this template onto a piece of coloured card. You can buy this
from art supply shops; I recommend a weight of around 300 gm<sup>-2</sup>.
Make sure you choose a colour you like! If you want the fish to be different
colours I’m afraid you’re simply going to have to print this out several times
on different coloured sheets.

_Step 2:_ cut out the fish shapes with a sharp knife, and use a hole punch (or
possibly a scalpel) for the eyes. Then use a large needle to make a hole
through the fin, where indicated.

_Step 3:_ take some fine cotton thread, and thread it through the fin hole. Tie
the end to the main piece of thread, so the fish won’t fall off. You can now
attach the fish to a coathanger or circular piece of wire, and hang the
completed mobile from a lampshade, or something else high enough to ensure you
don’t bump your head on it.

_Step 4:_ admire your handiwork.
