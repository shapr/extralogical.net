This downloadable PDF template will allow you to create your very own fish
mobile. The template only uses black ink, so it should print on any normal
desktop printer.

The mobile made its debut in [this entry](/2006/01/fish-mobile), which
includes a small gallery of readers' mobiles. If you've made your own, please,
[send in](/about) a photo or three!

Instructions
------------

1.  Print this template onto a piece of coloured card. You can buy this from
    art supply shops; I recommend a weight of around 300 gm<sup>-2</sup>. If
    you want the fish to be different colours I'm afraid you're simply going to
    have to print this out several times on different coloured sheets.
2.  Cut out the fish shapes with a sharp knife, and use a hole punch for the
    eyes. Then use a large needle to make a hole through the fin, where
    indicated.
3.  Take some fine cotton thread, and thread it through the fin hole. Tie the
    end to the main piece of thread, so the fish won't fall off. You can now
    attach the fish to a coat hanger or circular piece of wire, and hang the
    completed mobile from a lampshade, or something else high enough to ensure
    you donâ€™t bump your head on it.
