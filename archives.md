Extralogical has been around for over five years. Here's the greatest hits
collection.


[2005]($root/2005)
------------------

During the first year of the site I [contemplated jazz][jazz], got
[annoyed with Hollywood][faces], and [thought about America][empty],
particularly its [landscape][ormerod]. Worrying about the
[open source ecology][ecology] and [reviewing a little music][music],
[2005]($root/2005) saw me wrote the most---and, depressingly, the best---that I
have done.

[2006]($root/2006)
------------------

The [fish mobile][mobile] is probably still my favourite thing on the site.
Unsurprisingly, I'm still terrible at [finishing all my books][reading],
[writing code for general consumption][pubpriv] is still a complete pain, and
I've completely failed to follow my own advice regarding
[documenting weblog themes][docs]. [Philip K. Dick][pkd] made a repeat
appearance, and [Tarski took its first bow][tarski]. All in all,
[2006]($root/2006) was a busy year in which I wrote more than I realised at the
time, and even found time to make a few things.

[2007]($root/2007)
------------------

[Finding a good caf√©][cafe] remains tricky, and London is still
[pretty grim at times][london], but I'm less sure I still agree with my
assertions about [approaches to teaching philosophy][teaching]. However, we
should definitely be
[injecting it into the brains of schoolchildren][education]. The rest of
[2007]($root/2007) was spent writing code and finishing my degree, so I wrote a
number of WordPress-related articles which are unsatisfying to reread.

[2008]($root/2008)
------------------

In [2008]($root/2008) I [introduced Paper Trail][papertrail], a small Ruby on
Rails application for [keeping track][books] of my reading. The year was
notable for the code I wrote, including [updates to Tarski][tarski2] and some
[improvements to WordPress][themes], but articles were few and far between.

  [themes]:     $root/2008/08/theme-inheritance


[2009]($root/2009)
------------------

[2009]($root/2009) mostly consisted of hacking rather than writing. I released
[Stylish][stylish], a Ruby DSL for generating CSS, and [URLify][urlify], a
library for replacing characters with diacritics with their unaccented
equivalents. My article about [switching to Ruby 1.9][ruby19] became
[unexpectedly popular][r19yc].
